This AI Technical Agent is a Python-based tool designed to generate detailed technical responses to specific user-defined questions or concepts, leveraging Google Generative AIâ€™s Gemini-2.0 model. The agent provides StackOverflow-style responses, including working code examples and suggested technical resources, while maintaining an informal yet tech-oriented tone. It automates the process of content generation, saves the results in a CSV file, and further converts the generated responses into Markdown files for structured documentation.
